# What is a neural network?

The Hierarchy

AI → ML → NN → DL → GAN

---

AI

- Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving.

---

ML

- subset of AI
- setting computers up to be able to perform tasks without the need for explicit programming

---

### Problem with Traditional Programming

Traditional computer programs are designed to be good at

- Performing arithmetic really fast
- Explicitly following a list of instructions

But we cannot write the list of instructions to recognize a face or to write a instruction to automatically recognize someone's handwriting.

### Building an Intelligent Machine

Consider the example of an 'infant brain'. 

Within a matter of months after birth, infants can recognize the faces of their parents, discern discrete objects from their backgrounds, and even tell apart voices.

NN & DL are umm a simulation of human brain.
