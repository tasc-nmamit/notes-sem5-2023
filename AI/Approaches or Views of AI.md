## Acting Humanly - Turing Test approach

In order to act like human, what all components/capabilities should a AI system possess?

- **natural language processing** to enable it to communicate successfully in a human language
- **knowledge representation** to store information provided before or during the interrogation
- **automated reasoning** to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
- **machine learning** to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns

Problem with turing test - Turing test is not reproducible, constructive or amendable to mathematical analysis

## Thinking Humanly - Cognitive modelling approach

Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific **study of the mind** and its processes (thought, learning, mental organization etc.) with input from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science/artificial intelligence, and anthropology.

3 ways to learn more about human mind

- through introspection
- through psychological experiments
- through brain imaging

## Thinking Rationally - Laws of thoughts approach

The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to come up with these Laws of thoughts. For example, if we know that "Socrates is a man" and "all men are mortal," we can logically conclude that "Socrates is mortal."

In the laws of thought approach to AI, the whole emphasis was on correct inferences. (ps. inference is a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning)

## Acting Rationally - Rational agent approach

An **agent** is just something that perceives and acts. n this approach, AI is viewed as the study and construction of rational agents.

Making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one way to act rationally is to think rationally towards a conclusion and then act towards it.

On the other hand, correct inference is not _all_ of rationality, because **there are often situations where there is no provably correct thing to do**, yet something must still be done. There are also ways of acting rationally that cannot be reasonably said to involve inference. For example, pulling one's hand off of a hot stove is a reflex action that is more successful than a slower action taken after careful deliberation.
